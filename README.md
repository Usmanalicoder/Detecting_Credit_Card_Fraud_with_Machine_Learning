Detecting credit card fraud with machine learning involves distinguishing between normal and fraudulent transactions based on various features. 

**Normal transactions** are those that align with typical user behavior and transaction patterns. These transactions usually fall within the user’s historical spending limits and geographical location. For instance, if a user frequently makes small purchases in their local area, a transaction that matches this pattern—such as a purchase at a familiar store within the usual amount range—would be classified as normal. The transaction's metadata, including the time, amount, and merchant, generally conforms to the user’s historical spending habits.

In contrast, **fraudulent transactions** exhibit anomalies or deviations from established patterns. These transactions may involve unusually high amounts, be conducted in a different geographical location from the user's typical transactions, or occur at odd hours. For example, if a credit card that is usually used for small purchases in one city suddenly shows a large purchase in a foreign country, this would trigger suspicion. Fraudulent transactions may also exhibit patterns such as rapid successive transactions or purchases at high-risk merchants. Machine learning models are trained to recognize these deviations by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that signify fraud. Through techniques such as anomaly detection and supervised learning, these models can effectively flag transactions that deviate significantly from a user’s typical behavior, thereby helping to prevent financial loss and protect cardholders from fraud.
